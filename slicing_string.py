# Python - Slicing Strings
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):
b = "hello world"

print(b[2:5])

# Note: The first character has index 0.



# Slice From the Start
b = "hello world"
print(b[:5])




# slice to end
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])


# Negative Indexing

# Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

b = "hello world"
print(b[-5:-2])
